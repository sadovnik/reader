# Reader
Reader is a simple feed reader app.

## Background
I am learning Rails. To discover all quirks of it I started from naive implementation of this app. As I get comfortable with current implementation I will introduce new tools and refactor stuff. To make refactoring process less painful I try to write as much functional tests as I can.

This is list of what I'm going to discover:
- [x] [state_machines](https://github.com/state-machines/state_machines)
- [ ] [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl)
- [ ] [Trailblazer](http://trailblazer.to/)
- [ ] Delayed jobs
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] View caching
