<p>Andy Baio, on the About page for the newly relaunched Upcoming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2003, before Flickr or Facebook, Upcoming was the
first site to use a social network for event discovery. After two
years, Upcoming was acquired by Yahoo, running for a decade before
Yahoo shuttered it in 2013.</p>

<p>Shortly after they shut it down, Yahoo offered to sell the domain
back to me, an unprecedented move for a former acquisition.</p>

<p>I decided to launch a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/description">Kickstarter project</a> to gauge interest
in bringing Upcoming back from the dead. With the incredible
support and infinite patience of <a href="https://upcoming.org/about/backers">1,787 backers</a>, I rebuilt
Upcoming from scratch, restored the <a href="http://archive.upcoming.org/">event archive</a>, and
relaunched the community in March 2017.</p>

<p>Thank you for believing in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks great. Somehow feels karmically right that the return of Upcoming has coincided with the end of The Deck.</p>

<p>Dan Frommer, writing for Recode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Apple pioneered the all-screen phone concept with the first
iPhone, Samsung and other companies have recently pushed it
further, trimming the frame around the display so much that the
forehead and chin on the new Galaxy S8 are barely there.</p>

<p>For another example, Andy Rubin &#8212; the founder of Android, and
before that one of the people behind the Sidekick phone &#8212;
recently tweeted a teaser photo of another slick-looking,
edge-to-edge device, presumably from the <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/13/14267664/android-andy-rubin-smartphone-essential">handset company he’s
working on, called Essential</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubin&#8217;s teaser shot for the Essential truly is impressive &#8212; it shows a true edge-to-edge design, with almost no bezels on either the sides <em>or</em> the top and bottom. Looks very cool. But: it&#8217;s vaporware. Shipping is what counts, and the Galaxy S8 is shipping.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing that Apple is working on an &#8220;edge-to-edge&#8221; iPhone design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/11/2017-iphone-edge-to-edge-display/">since early last year</a>. If Apple truly eliminates the chin and forehead, they&#8217;ll leap ahead of Samsung. But I don&#8217;t see how anyone can deny that Samsung is ahead in the race to eliminate bezels.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to &#8220;design&#8221; than how a phone looks from the front, though. And to me, the Galaxy S8 looks like it was only designed with the front face in mind. I don&#8217;t think the back looks good, and the placement of the fingerprint scanner is undeniably awkward. And the ports and speaker holes on the bottom are, <a href="http://www.imore.com/galaxy-s7-samsung-still-cant-achieve-apple-level-industrial-design">as usual</a> for Samsung, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lionyoung1987/status/847702481538658304">misaligned</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter&#8217;s design team, explaining why they changed the default new user avatar from an egg to a bland silhouette:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve noticed patterns of behavior with accounts that are created
only to harass others &#8212; often they don’t take the time to
personalize their accounts. This has created an association
between the default egg profile photo and negative behavior, which
isn’t fair to people who are still new to Twitter and haven’t yet
personalized their profile photo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so ridiculous that a lot of people suspected it was an April Fool&#8217;s gag. The problem is the actual harassment, not the egg icons. Changing the icon doesn&#8217;t affect the actual problem <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/847846736592748545">a bad idea</a>. The egg was something Twitter owned. It fit marvelously with their brand. Their icon is a bird. Their &#8220;new tweet&#8221; button shows a feather. The egg felt totally Twitter. This new silhouette looks like it came out of a stock icon set.</p>

<p>(There is some interesting stuff in this post about the work they did to make the silhouette feel gender-neutral rather than male.)</p>

<p>Ryan Knutson, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among the changes in an iPhone software update Apple Inc.
released this week: a fix aimed at preventing cyberattacks
on 911 centers in the U.S.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was exposed in October after an 18-year-old in
Arizona allegedly designed code that would cause iPhones to
repeatedly dial 911. A link to the code went viral on Twitter, as
teenagers began sharing it as a prank.</p>

<p>The incident, which was detailed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-cyberattack-overwhelmed-the-911-system-1488554972">in a Wall Street Journal
article</a>, resulted in thousands of accidental 911 calls,

<p>Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology
from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth
Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his
lawyers.</p>

<p>The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Google’s
self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at
Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights
because there was “potential for criminal action” in the case,
according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pleading the Fifth is <em>not</em> an admission of guilt, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t look good. And “potential for criminal action” is a new wrinkle.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the end of The Deck.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>When I started writing Daring Fireball in 2002, there really weren&#8217;t any established ways for a small independent website to generate money. I mean like literally nothing. I knew, though, that it was what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to write. But I didn&#8217;t want to write books. I didn&#8217;t want to write for a newspaper or a magazine or someone else&#8217;s website. I wanted to write Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>I plugged away, writing as much as I could, doing it as a hobby. And I just started trying ways to generate revenue, with one guiding rule: don&#8217;t do anything I&#8217;m not proud of. In 2003 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2003/07/independent_days">I first announced publicly</a> my intention to one day write Daring Fireball full-time, and began a brief experiment with Google AdSense. (Daring Fireball was literally one of the first sites on the web showing ads from Google). It didn&#8217;t work well financially, or look good. In June 2004 I <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring">started selling t-shirts</a> and a $19/year membership system. That worked better.</p>

<p>A few months later, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/09/sponsor_this">I started selling my own sponsorships</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effective Tuesday evening, I abandoned Google’s AdSense program,
in favor of selling my own sponsorships. If you’ll take a look at
the bottom of my sidebar, you’ll see an ad from Daring Fireball’s
first sponsor: <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20040923142958/http://jewelboxing.com/indexdf.php">Coudal Partners’ Jewelboxing</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus began the best business partnership of my life.</p>

<p>In early 2006, Jim Coudal started The Deck, with Jeffrey Zeldman and 37signals (now Basecamp). <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/02/bedecked">I joined in early February</a>, making Daring Fireball the fourth site in the network. Andy Baio, Jason Kottke, and The Morning News joined soon thereafter. In March, we had <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2006/03/16/things-said/">a group dinner</a> in Austin during SXSW. I remember a palpable sense of accomplishment. I remember thinking, <em>This is going to work.</em></p>

<p>A month later <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/initiative">I announced I was going full-time writing Daring Fireball</a>. It worked.</p>

<p>Today, 11 years later, <a href="http://decknetwork.net/">Jim announced that The Deck is shutting down</a>: &#8220;Things change.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Jewelboxing was DF&#8217;s first sponsor. I devised my original sponsorship system &#8212; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/09/sponsor_this">a set of principles more than a set of rules</a> &#8212; through commiseration and collaboration with my friend Jim Coudal. We shared the same deep frustration: a sense that there <em>had</em> to be a way to do advertising on the web that didn&#8217;t suck &#8212; something that readers would not mind (and might actually enjoy), provided good results for the advertisers, and generated good money for the publisher.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the things that make me proud to have been part of The Deck:</p>

<ul>
<li>We never allowed animated ads. (Remember when <em>that</em> was the main problem with online ads?)</li>
<li>We never allowed user tracking or JavaScript payloads. The Deck respected your <a href="http://decknetwork.net/privacy/">privacy</a> (and your <a href="https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/la-times-and-ads/">bandwidth</a>).</li>
<li>We had great sponsors who made great products and services (and designed great looking ads).</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, we never showed more than one ad per page. From the beginning of web advertising, publishers have seemingly been in a race to cram as many ads per page as they can. In print magazines and newspapers, there are ads like that too, but they&#8217;re the low-rent pages in the back of the book. The real money in print comes from the prestigious ads that are exclusive. The back cover. The inside front cover spread. The full page opposite the table of contents. Exclusivity has tremendous value, and most web publishers still haven&#8217;t gotten that. And on the web, an ad doesn&#8217;t have to be big to be exclusive and to occupy valuable real estate.</p>

<p>I lost count long ago of the readers who wrote to me just to say that they whitelisted The Deck from their ad blockers. Not as a favor to me, but simply because they recognized that The Deck deserved not to be blocked. I love that.</p>

<p>I love The Deck.</p>

<hr />

<p>“<em>I write for my pleasure, but publish for money.</em>” <br />
<strong>—VLADIMIR NABOKOV</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used that quote <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring">before</a> when writing about the business side of Daring Fireball, but it&#8217;s a good enough quote to use at least once every decade.</p>

<p><a href="http://decknetwork.net/">As Jim wrote today</a>, what ultimately did The Deck in is the shift in advertising dollars to social networks and the rise of mobile:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2014, display advertisers started concentrating on large,
walled, social networks. The indie “blogosphere” was disappearing.
Mobile impressions, which produce significantly fewer clicks and
engagements, began to really dominate the market. Invasive user
tracking (which we <a href="http://decknetwork.net/privacy/">refused</a> to do) and all that came with that
became pervasive, and once again The Deck was back to being a
pretty good business. By 2015, it was an OK business and, by the
second half of 2016, the network was beginning to struggle again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277229/facebooks-annual-revenue-and-net-income/">This graph</a> showing Facebook&#8217;s revenue from 2007 through 2016 tells the story.</p>

<p>That said, Daring Fireball is doing fine. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/">DF RSS feed sponsorships</a> remain strong, and listenership and <a href="http://neat.fm/">sponsorships for The Talk Show</a> are growing. The Deck was only one leg among several on the DF revenue stool, and in recent years, it had become one of the shorter ones. I have not decided yet how or what to replace The Deck with. I feel certain of only one thing: things <em>have</em> changed, and it&#8217;s been too long since I experimented with new ideas. In terms of aggregate revenue, selling weekly RSS feed sponsorships is the best idea I&#8217;ve ever had &#8212; but it started as a lark, a last-ditch attempt to figure out a way to provide full-content RSS feeds to Google Reader users.<sup id="fnr1-2017-03-29"><a href="#fn1-2017-03-29">1</a></sup> It might be time to try a few larks again.</p>

<p>What hurts far more than the loss in revenue is the principle of the damn thing. The Deck did it right, and it worked for over a decade. I&#8217;m sure I would&#8217;ve gone full-time writing Daring Fireball sooner or later, but I couldn&#8217;t have done it when I did, in 2006, without The Deck.</p>

<p>I was chatting with Jim earlier this evening. Someone wrote to him to ask, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you sell the network instead of shutting it down?&#8221; Jim&#8217;s answer: &#8220;The Deck was built exclusively on close, personal relationships. I don’t think those are mine to sell.”</p>

<p>In 11 years, Jim and I never had anything more than a virtual handshake through Messages (née iChat) as a &#8220;contract&#8221;. They say don’t do business with friends. My experience says otherwise &#8212; if you have the right friends.</p>

<p>T.C. Sottek, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Republicans in Congress <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15080436/us-house-votes-to-let-isps-share-web-browsing-history">just voted to reverse a landmark FCC
privacy rule</a> that opens the door for ISPs to sell customer
data. Lawmakers provided no credible reason for this being in the
interest of Americans, except for vague platitudes about
“consumer choice” and “free markets,” as if consumers at the
mercy of their local internet monopoly are craving to have their
web history quietly sold to marketers and any other third party
willing to pay.</p>

<p>The only people who seem to want this are the people who are going
to make lots of money from it. (Hint: they work for companies like
Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.) Incidentally, these people and their
companies routinely give lots of money to members of Congress.</p>

<p>So here is a list of the lawmakers who voted to betray you, and
how much money they received from the telecom industry in their
most recent election cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely and utterly along party lines. Not one Democrat voted for this. &#8220;Congress&#8221; didn&#8217;t do this. Republicans in Congress did this.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no argument that can be made in defense of this bill other than that the Republican party believes that increasing the profits of telecom companies is more important than protecting the privacy of people.</p>

<p>Nathan Peretic, one day after Zeldman&#8217;s post in February 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>coup de grâce</em>, history will note, was Apple’s release of the
iPhone sans Flash. The mobile Internet became a force to reckon
with overnight, single-handedly trashing Flash’s former claim of
ubiquity. The iPhone has gashed a gigantic hole in the number of
people browsing the Internet who don’t have Flash. The iPad is
poised to increase that number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an excellent summation of the logic that doomed Flash.</p>

<p>Before the iPhone and iPad, Flash was the easiest way to publish multimedia viewable by the largest audience. The percentage of web-viewing devices with Flash Player installed, right from the factory, was surely in the high 90s. In an ideal world, web publishers would have aggressively moved to HTML5 simply because it was a better &#8212; and open &#8212; technology. But that wasn&#8217;t enough of a motivation.</p>

<p>Almost every device could play Flash content. Many devices could <em>not</em> render HTML5 content, because they were junky PCs running Internet Explorer. Publishers went for the larger group, technology be damned.</p>

<p>Starting with the iPhone, there was no longer any way to publish multimedia in one format for &#8220;almost all&#8221; devices. You could stick with Flash and ignore mobile, or you could switch to HTML5 and leave legacy PCs running old browsers behind. The choice was easy.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Zeldman, back in February 2010 (two months before Steve Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;Thoughts on Flash&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flash won’t die tomorrow, but plug-in technology is on its
way out.</p>

<p>Plug-in technology made sense when web browsing was the province
of geeks. It was a brilliant solution to the question of how to
extend the user experience beyond what HTML allowed. People who
were used to extending their PC via third-party hardware, and
jacking the capabilities of their operating system via third-party
spell checkers, font managers, and more, intuitively grasped how
to boost their browser’s prowess by downloading and updating
plug-ins.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/359224392/i-need-to-talk-to-you-about-computers-ive-been">tomorrow’s computing systems</a>, heralded by the iPhone, are <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/357323170/free">not
for DIYers</a>. You don’t add Default Folder or FontExplorer X Pro to
your iPhone, you don’t choose your iPhone’s browser, and you don’t
install plug-ins in your iPhone’s browser. This lack of
extensibility may not please the Slashdot crowd but it’s the
future of computing and browsing. The bulk of humanity doesn’t
want a <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">computing experience it can tinker with</a>; it wants a
computing experience that works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had your eyes open, you could see that Flash was doomed as soon as it became clear that the iPhone had changed the world.</p>

]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2017/03/27/ubers-korean-escort-visit-shows-sexism-cover-up-goes-to-the-top/">Brian Solomon, writing for Forbes</a> about Uber&#8217;s South Korean &#8220;karaoke/escort bar&#8221; scandal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If true, that incident would be bad enough, but it appears to have
emerged solely due to Uber&#8217;s attempts to cover it up. According to
Holzwarth, Emil Michael called her three weeks ago as the news
about Uber&#8217;s workplace culture became a full-fledged scandal.
Michael allegedly asked her not to speak to the press and to
pretend the visit was simply to a regular karaoke bar. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/uber-groups-visit-to-seoul-escort-bar-sparked-hr-complaint">From The
Information</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Mr. Michael called, he told her that “things have been
really rough out here,” referring to Uber’s issues. He then said,
“Remember that night in Korea?” There are reporters, he said, who
will try to “break the story and I just want to go over things
with you. We just went to a karaoke bar and that’s all that
happened, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<em>It&#8217;s not the crime, it&#8217;s the cover-up</em>&#8221; is a cliché, but in this case it&#8217;s true. I didn&#8217;t emphasize that in my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/26/uber-seoul">first post about this incident</a>. Here&#8217;s what I think:</p>

<p>Personally, I think these establishments are morally repulsive.</p>

<p>I understand that Asian culture is different from U.S. culture, and I understand that part of Asian culture &#8212; certainly in South Korea &#8212; is “doing business” in such establishments. But <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/uber-groups-visit-to-seoul-escort-bar-sparked-hr-complaint">The Information&#8217;s story</a> doesn’t say the Uber execs were “doing business” with Koreans. They were a bunch of Americans out amongst themselves, so the cultural norms of South Korea aren’t relevant.</p>

<p>And, most importantly, the real issue here is Emil Michael asking Gabi Holzwarth to lie about the incident. That’s outrageous. It should be considered a firing offense even if you personally think these “karaoke/escort” joints are A-OK. In addition to being the wrong thing to do, morally, it was also incredibly stupid, because Holzwarth told The Information that the reason she came forward with the story is because she was so outraged (rightfully so) by Michael&#8217;s request that she lie about the incident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not going to lie for them,” she said in an interview with The
Information this week. In the interview, she described Mr.
Kalanick as “part of a class of privileged men who have been
taught they can do whatever they want, and now they can.”</p>

<p>She said she wouldn’t have considered speaking publicly had Mr.
Michael not attempted to “silence” her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see the argument for keeping a personally reprehensible executive who is doing amazing work. I’m not saying I agree with it. I don&#8217;t, actually. I’m just saying I can see the logic. I can’t see the logic in keeping a personally reprehensible executive who would do something as <em>stupid</em> — not just wrong but stupid — as calling a former colleague and telling her to lie to the media if asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Virgil&#8221;, responding to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/03/24/fedex-flash">my piece</a> the other day looking back at Steve Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a>&#8221; open letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Impossible to refute. There’s no doubt that this was the beginning
of the end for Flash, right? Except that this is utterly wrong. I
worked on Flash, and I worked on the thing that actually killed
Flash. It is my strong belief, based on what I observed, that
Steve Jobs’ letter had little impact in the final decision &#8212; it
was really Adobe who decided to “kill” Flash. Yes, Flash was a bad
rap for Adobe, and Steve&#8217;s letter didn’t help. But ultimately,
what was probably decisive was the fact that developing Flash
costed Adobe a ton of money &#8212; and the world changed in ways that
made Adobe leadership believe this investment is no longer
justified. As it is often the case &#8212; “follow the money”, they
explain things better than any open letter &#8212; even one from a very
influential person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t think Jobs&#8217;s letter killed Flash. But I don&#8217;t think Adobe did either. Eventually Adobe accepted Flash&#8217;s demise. What killed Flash was Apple&#8217;s decision not to support it on iOS, combined with iOS&#8217;s immense popularity and the lucrative demographics of iOS users. If Jobs had never published &#8220;Thoughts on Flash&#8221;, Flash would still be dead. The letter explained the decision, but the decision that mattered was never to support it on iOS in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that Flash would have died even if Apple had decided to allow it on iOS. Android tried that, and the results were abysmal. Web page scrolling stuttered, and video playback through Flash Player <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/24/flash-android-browser">halved battery life</a> compared to non-Flash playback. Android&#8217;s experiment with Flash Player ended quickly, and if Apple had gone down the same path, it likely would have ended quickly there too.</p>

<p>Flash was just a bad fit technically for mobile, and the rise of mobile was inevitable. But Apple was the first player to recognize that.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s first post-acquisition update of the iOS automation app Workflow removed (<a href="http://tidbits.com/article/17127">among other things</a>) support for the Google Chrome browser. Immediate reaction from the peanut gallery is that this was competitive spite on Apple&#8217;s part. Maybe! But maybe not &#8212; Marco Arment reports that he was asked a few weeks ago to sign a one-page contract to allow Workflow to interact with Overcast, and speculates quite reasonably that perhaps Google ignored or rejected the same request.</p>

<p>Great collection of audio clips from Guilbert Gates for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chuck Berry himself would be the first to admit he didn’t invent
rock ’n’ roll, but he came to define it in a series of iconic
singles made between 1955 and 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. Berry wrote almost all his hits himself, and he drew from the
music he loved &#8212; from the blues and boogie to country and
Calypso. The result was a hybrid sound that, in 1955, was just
beginning to be called “rock ’n’ roll.”</p>

<p>Here, an audio guide to just a few of his revolutionary songs:
what came before, and what came after. Listen to the sound of rock
’n’ roll being made.</p>

<p>Joe Flint and Shalini Ramachandran, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is expanding into new genres such as children’s fare, reality
TV and stand-up comedy specials &#8212; including a $40 million deal
for two shows by Chris Rock. The shift has unnerved some TV
networks that had become used to Netflix’s original content being
focused on scripted dramas and sitcoms.</p>

<p>Netflix’s spending on original and acquired programming this year
is expected to be more than $6 billion, up from $5 billion last
year, more than double what Time Warner Inc.’s HBO spends and five
times as much as 21st Century Fox’s FX or CBS Corp.’s Showtime. It
spent close to $10 million an episode on “The Crown,” a lavish
period drama about a young Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>Its shock-and-awe spending &#8212; combined with that of Amazon and
other new players &#8212; is driving up costs industrywide and creating
a scarcity of people and equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TV network executives five years ago: <em>This is great, we found someone willing to pay us for our back catalog of old crappy TV shows.</em></p>

<p>TV network executives today: <em>Nobody could&#8217;ve seen this coming, this is terrible.</em></p>

<p>(We just watched Dave Chappelle&#8217;s two new stand-up specials for Netflix over the weekend. Fucking hilarious &#8212; highly recommended.)</p>

<p>David Sparks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Apple first announced this new system, I expected it would be
years before we saw it on iPhones. The iPhone is the lifeblood of
Apple and changing filesystems can sometimes cause problems. Now
here we are less than 12 months after announcement and Apple’s
installing APFS across all iPhones and iPads.</p>

<p>Following my usual “fire, ready, aim” philosophy about these
things, I already updated all of my iOS devices and while the
update took a while (converting a file system is never a fast
process), everything went just fine and devices are all working
just like before. Indeed, I&#8217;m writing this post on my updated
iPad Pro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I upgraded my phone today, and it did seem to me that it took an unusual amount of time. Understandable, considering it was changing the file system. This is one of those things where if it all goes according to plan, normal people will have no idea it happened. But for us nerds, what Apple pulled off today seems almost impossible &#8212; tens of millions of devices are being upgraded to an altogether brand new file system, in place, silently. My sincere congratulations to Apple&#8217;s file system team on a job well done.</p>

<p>Amir Efrati, reporting for The Information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ms. Holzwarth, who described the bar in vivid detail in an
interview with The Information, said she and Mr. Kalanick left
less than an hour after the men in Uber’s group picked some women
to sit with. She doesn’t know what happened after she left.</p>

<p>Mr. Michael’s call prompted her to discuss her concerns with
Uber’s top public relations executive Rachel Whetstone and Mr.
Kalanick, among other people. She described and provided
correspondence of those conversations for this story.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to lie for them,” she said in an interview with The
Information this week. In the interview, she described Mr.
Kalanick as “part of a class of privileged men who have been
taught they can do whatever they want, and now they can.”</p>

<p>She said she wouldn’t have considered speaking publicly had Mr.
Michael not attempted to “silence” her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like this was less like a strip club and more like a brothel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High-end escort-karaoke bars are fairly common in Seoul, often
frequented by businessmen, who pick out women to drink with.
Karaoke is typically a feature of the evening. The men can choose
to have sex with the women as well. Prostitution is illegal in
South Korea.</p>

<p>My thanks to Quentin Zervaas &#8212; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/03/streaks">remember Streaks</a>? &#8212; for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed to promote HealthFace. HealthFace goes <em>deep</em> on exposing health information as a complication on any Apple Watch face. Any data from HealthKit can be shown, and it&#8217;s easy to configure it to show different data on different watch faces &#8212; you can, say, show your sleep data on the Utility face and your blood pressure on Modular. The interface for configuring the complications is better than Apple&#8217;s.</p>

<p>If you have any interest in displaying your HealthKit data on your Apple Watch, HealthFace is the app for you. And it&#8217;s a great deal &#8212; a one-time purchase of just $1.99.</p>

<p>Washington Post reporter Robert Costa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31
p.m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint since it
was a blocked number.</p>

<p>Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His
voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob,” Trump began. “So, we just pulled it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a meta level, it&#8217;s fascinating to me that Trump made these phone calls personally. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/business/26nocera.html">It reminds me of Steve Jobs&#8217;s phone call to New York Times columnist Joe Nocera</a> back in 2008:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday afternoon, several hours after I’d gotten my final
“Steve’s health is a private matter” &#8212; and much to my amazement
&#8212; Mr. Jobs called me. “This is Steve Jobs,” he began. “You think
I’m an arrogant [expletive] who thinks he’s above the law, and I
think you’re a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.”
After that rather arresting opening, he went on to say that he
would give me some details about his recent health problems, but
only if I would agree to keep them off the record. I tried to
argue him out of it, but he said he wouldn’t talk if I insisted on
an on-the-record conversation. So I agreed.</p>

<p>Philip Bump, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I never said I was going to repeal and replace in the first 61
days,” he said to Costa with a laugh &#8212; undercounting his time in
office by a bit. When he offered a public statement a bit later,
he’d figured out the proper number. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Trump is correct: At no point in time did he pledge to repeal and
replace Obamacare in 61 or 64 days. Instead, he pledged to demand
a repeal on Day One &#8212; even if it took a special session of
Congress to make it happen. He pledged on several occasions to
repeal it “immediately.” The message he conveyed to his voters was
very much not that “this is something we will get to eventually”
but that this was something that would come first on the agenda.</p>

<p>Ezra Klein, writing for Vox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump promised to be a different kind of president. He was
a populist fighting on behalf of the “forgotten man,” taking on
the GOP establishment, draining the Washington swamp, protecting
Medicaid from cuts, vowing to cover everyone with health care and
make the government pay for it. He was a pragmatic businessman who
was going to make Washington work for you, the little guy, not the
ideologues and special interests.</p>

<p>Instead, Trump has become a pitchman for Paul Ryan and his agenda.
He’s spent the past week fighting for a health care bill he didn’t
campaign on, didn’t draft, <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/17/14961066/donald-trump-gop-health-bill">doesn’t understand</a>, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-health-care-plan-aides-236266">doesn’t like
to talk about</a>, and <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/22/15028278/trumps-weak-closing-argument-on-health-care-and-why-it-matters">can’t defend</a>. Rather than forcing the
Republican establishment to come around to his principles, he’s
come around to theirs &#8212; with disastrous results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/trump-health-care-bill-regrets.html">Here&#8217;s how Trump learned</a> the news that the vote on the AHCA bill had been called off:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the mid-afternoon, a beaming Mr. Trump climbed into the rig of a
black tractor-trailer, which had been driven to the White House
for an event with trucking industry executives, honking the horn
and posing for a series of tough-guy photos &#8212; one with his fists
held aloft, another staring straight ahead, hands gripping the
large wheel, his face compressed into an excited scream.</p>

<p>At a meeting inside shortly afterward, Mr. Trump announced that he
was pressed for time and needed to go make calls for more votes.</p>

<p>A reporter informed him that the vote had already been called off.</p>

<p>Brilliant. Heinz is actually running ads from Don Draper&#8217;s rejected ketchup campaign from <em>Mad Men</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifty years ago, in the fictional world of Mad Men, Don Draper
pitched a daring ad campaign to Heinz execs, for the brand’s
ketchup, that proposed not showing the product at all. Instead,
the ads would show close-ups of foods that go great with ketchup
&#8212; french fries, a cheeseburger, a slice of steak &#8212; but without
any ketchup in sight.</p>

<p>Don’s proposed tagline: “Pass the Heinz.”</p>

  <p>Adobe Flash has been on the ropes since Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">went on his
famous tirade 7 years ago</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean some sites don&#8217;t
still require it.</p>

<p>For its part, FedEx is <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/no-flash.html">apologizing to customers and offering $5

the browser plug-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FedEx needs to get its shit together. This is pathetic.</p>

<p>Also, &#8220;tirade&#8221; is a terrible description of Steve Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a>&#8221;. The dictionary defines <em>tirade</em> as &#8220;a long, angry speech of criticism or accusation&#8221;. Go ahead and re-read Jobs&#8217;s essay. There&#8217;s not a single angry word in it. What made it so devastating is that it <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> angry. It was calm, cool, collected, and true.</p>

<p>If it had been an angry rant, it would have been easily dismissed without needing to be factually refuted &#8212; &#8220;<em>That&#8217;s just Jobs being a prick again.</em>&#8221; The fact that it wasn&#8217;t angry, and because it was all true, made it impossible to refute.</p>

<p>Kim Hart, Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin riled the tech community this
morning when <a href="https://www.axios.com/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-interviews-with-axios-live-updates-2327865447.html">he told Axios&#8217;s Mike Allen</a> that displacement of jobs
by artificial intelligence and automation is &#8220;not even on my radar
screen&#8221; because the technology is &#8220;50-100 more years&#8221; away.
Mnuchin also said he is &#8220;not worried at all&#8221; about robots
displacing humans in the near future. &#8220;In fact, I&#8217;m optimistic.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/24/technology/robots-jobs-us-workers-uk/index.html">Report issued today from PricewaterhouseCoopers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Millions of workers around the world are at risk of losing their
jobs to robots &#8212; but Americans should be particularly worried. 38
percent of jobs in the U.S. are at high risk of being replaced by
robots and artificial intelligence over the next 15 years,
according to a new report by PwC.</p>

<p>Whoa, huge news for iOS nerds. Matthew Panzarino has the scoop:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Workflow has been around for a couple of years and we’ve covered
it and its updates. It shares some similarity with the service
IFTTT, in that it allows people to group together a bunch of
actions that can allow them to perform complicated tasks with one
tap. It had built up a sizeable number of users and downloads over
the past few years.</p>

<p>Workflow the app is being acquired, along with the team of
Weinstein, Conrad Kramer and Nick Frey. In a somewhat uncommon
move for Apple, the app will continue to be made available on the
App Store and will be made free later today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This certainly provides ammunition against the argument that Apple no longer cares about power users. For me this is Apple&#8217;s most intriguing and exciting acquisition in years.</p>

<p>Personally, Workflow never really clicked for me, but I&#8217;ve been meaning to give it another try. The problem for me isn&#8217;t Workflow itself, but iOS. MacOS, at a conceptual level, matches the way my brain works for nerdy custom automation stuff &#8212; I just <em>get</em> Unix shell scripting languages, AppleScript-able Mac apps, and NeXTstep&#8217;s brilliant system-wide Services menu. Doing things the iOS way via Workflow looks cool, but whenever it comes down to it, it always feels easier to me to just wait until I&#8217;m at a Mac and create it there.</p>

<p>But one of the things that has always impressed me, and which has paid off for them in the end, is that Workflow stayed true to the platform. Workflow was designed from the ground up as a true and native iOS service. It is one of the most <em>iOS-y</em> pieces of software ever created. They took the severe limits of inter-application communication on iOS and <em>embraced</em> them.</p>

<p>Alex Cranz, Gizmodo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coming a year after the launch of Apple’s first 9.7-inch iPad Pro,
the new iteration from Samsung feels daring. While it has the same
sleek lines, is just as light, and possesses the magnetic
connection on one side for easy keyboard cover attachment,
Samsung’s iPad Pro for 2017 is, inexplicably called the Galaxy Tab
S3, and unlike previous iPads this one runs on Android.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Samsung is so stupid with their insistence on printing their ugly logo on the front face of any device where it&#8217;ll fit. You&#8217;re obviously supposed to use this tablet in landscape orientation any time it&#8217;s connected to the keyboard case, or any time you watch a video. For many users, that might be the majority of their time using the device. And when the device is in landscape, the logo is oriented wrong. That&#8217;s just plain stupid.</p>

<p>And look at their asymmetrical copy of the iPad&#8217;s Smart Connector. Says everything you need to know about Samsung&#8217;s care for the little details.</p>

No new iPad Pro hardware at all. Just a no-adjective 9.7-inch &#8220;iPad&#8221; to replace the iPad Air 2. It&#8217;s a nice update for the budget-conscious: the new iPad has a brighter screen and an A9 instead of an A8 chip, and costs $70 less. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/14/march-air">As predicted</a>, Apple is clearly putting the &#8220;Air&#8221; brand out to pasture.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/03/apple-introduces-clips-the-fun-new-way-to-create-expressive-videos-on-ios.html">Clips</a>: Looks cool, especially the part about dictating the titles verbally. But it doesn&#8217;t ship until April.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Update:</strong> Also, the iPhone SE storage tiers have been <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/">bumped from 16/64 to 32/128 GB</a>. That means Apple is no longer selling any 16 GB iPhones (<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/">or iPads for that matter</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(A thought about the missing updates to the iPad Pro lineup: it seems like the supply chain leaks are mostly related to displays. A 10.5-inch display would necessarily require a new hardware design, because that&#8217;s a new display size for iPads. But what if the next update to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro <em>also</em> sports a new smaller-bezel design? Same display size as the current big iPad Pro, but a smaller footprint? When Apple makes multiple sizes of the same device family, they generally look as similar as possible other than the difference in size. It would be weird if, later this year, Apple released two new iPad Pros, but only one of them sported a new edge-to-edge display.)</p>

<p>Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala, of Google Research Europe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Google, we care about giving users the best possible online
experience, both through our own services and products and by
contributing new tools and industry standards for use by the
online community. That’s why we’re excited to announce
<a href="https://github.com/google/guetzli/">Guetzli</a>, a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04421">new open source algorithm</a> that creates high
quality JPEG images with file sizes 35% smaller than currently
available methods, enabling webmasters to create webpages that can
load faster and use even less data.</p>

<p>Guetzli [guɛtsli] &#8212; <em>cookie</em> in Swiss German &#8212; is a JPEG encoder
for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online
experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still
maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing
applications and the JPEG standard. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>And while Guetzli produces smaller image file sizes without
sacrificing quality, we additionally found that in experiments
where compressed image file sizes are kept constant that human
raters consistently preferred the images Guetzli produced over
libjpeg images, even when the libjpeg files were the same size or
even slightly larger. We think this makes the slower compression a
worthy tradeoff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#8217;re not exaggerating. I installed Guetzli (via <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>) and it produces JPEGs that are about one-third smaller and yet look the same to my eyes. It&#8217;s a significant breakthrough for such a venerable image format.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a catch. Image processing is <em>really</em> slow. It takes about 8 minutes for Guetzli to process a single iPhone camera image on my 5K iMac. That doesn&#8217;t mean Guetzli isn&#8217;t useful &#8212; it just isn&#8217;t useful in a user-facing context. If I ran a site that published photos, I&#8217;d hook it up in the background on the server hosting my images.</p>

<p>Charlie Warzel, writing for BuzzFeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Techmeme, then, wields tremendous power over a tremendously
powerful group of people. And as its founder, Rivera has been
quietly defining Silicon Valley’s narrative for the industry’s
power brokers for more than a decade. But Rivera is uncomfortable
&#8212; or unwilling &#8212; to reckon with how his influence has affected
one of the most important and powerful industries in the world.
The result is that Rivera can cast himself both as a gimlet-eyed
insider with a powerful readership and as a mostly anonymous
entrepreneur running a niche link blog from the comfort of his
home. It’s a convenient cognitive dissonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I visit Techmeme once or twice on typical workdays. But I find it essential  when I&#8217;m on vacation or otherwise offline for large stretches of time &#8212; it&#8217;s a great way to quickly check whether anything happened I need to know about. Nothing else like it.</p>

Will we be able to pay for tuition? In very short order, I
contacted the IRS and I paid what I owed. I paid American Express.
Since that time, I am fanatical about not owing anybody any money.
I hate it. I don’t want to carry a balance, ever. I have a
mortgage, but I despise the idea. That was my biggest objection to
buying property, though I wasn’t in the position to pay cash.</p>

<p>The reports of my net worth are about ten times overstated. I
think the people who calculate these things assume that I live a
lot more sensibly than I do. I mean, I don’t live recklessly &#8212; I
have one car. But I don’t deprive myself simple pleasures. I’m not
a haggler. There’s not enough time in the world. I tend to go for
the quickest, easiest, what’s comfortable. I want it now. Time’s
running out.</p>

<p>Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But in Monday’s remarkable, marathon hearing of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said there was
no such evidence. Trump’s claim, first made in a series of tweets
on March 4 at a moment when associates said he was feeling under
siege and stewing over the struggles of his young presidency,
remains unfounded.</p>

<p>Comey did not stop there. He confirmed publicly that the FBI was
investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign officials
and associates with Russia, part of an extraordinary effort by an
adversary to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. election in
Trump’s favor.</p>

<p>Questions about Russia have hung over Trump for months, but the
president always has dismissed them as “fake news.” That became
much harder Monday after the FBI director proclaimed the Russia
probe to be anything but fake.</p>

<p>“There’s a smell of treason in the air,” presidential historian
Douglas Brinkley said. “Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other
FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It
would have been a mind-boggling event.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As is our current predicament.</p>

<p>Looks like Samsung is beating Apple to the &#8220;hardly any chin or forehead&#8221; punch.

]]></summary>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2017-ipad-109-inch-screen-smaller-bezels-launch-in-march-barclays-2016-11">Business Insider, back in November</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is preparing new iPads for a launch in March, Barclays
analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn wrote in a note
distributed to clients on Friday. The analysts cite supply chain
sources spoken to during a trip to Asia.</p>

<p>&#8220;New iPads in March &#8212; Bezel-less [like the upcoming iPhone] &#8212; We
expect the 9.7-inch to move to a low-cost model, a refresh of the
12.9-inch pro and a new 10.9-inch, which is likely the same
physical size as the 9.7-inch but with a borderless screen,&#8221; the
analysts wrote.</p>

<p>A March iPad launch lines up with predictions <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ming-chi-kuo-2018-ipad-predictions-and-105-inch-ipad-2016-8">previously made by
KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. He predicted a
10.5-inch iPad next year, along with a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Japanese website <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-31938.html">Mac Otakara, a month ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last time, the Barclays analyst predicted the <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-31339.html">announcement</a> of
the addition of bezel less iPad Pro (10.5 inch) model in the next
iPad Pro series at the end of March 2017.</p>

<p>Also, the shipping of the iPad Pro 2 (12.9-inch), iPad Pro 2
(9.7-inch), iPad Pro (7.9-inch) at the end of March, and the iPad
Pro (10.5-inch) in May were also expected as a possibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New iPad Pro &#8220;2&#8221; models at the existing sizes make sense to me &#8212; iPads that look very similar (or even identical) to the existing 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros but with updated internals (A10X chips, better cameras, etc.). The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a year old, and the 12.9-inch model is almost a year and a half old.</p>

<p>An updated iPad Mini would make sense too. Right now the high-end iPad Mini is the iPad Mini 4, with an A8 chip. In the past, Apple has generally updated the iPad Mini models with internals from the year-ago flagship 9.7-inch models. That would suggest a new Mini with an A9 chip and perhaps support for Apple Pencil. Maybe they&#8217;d call it &#8220;iPad Mini Pro&#8221;. Or maybe just &#8220;iPad Pro&#8221; &#8212; the 9.7- and 12.9-inch models don&#8217;t have different names. Or maybe nothing at all &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if Apple has no imminent updates for the iPad Mini.</p>

<p>What doesn&#8217;t make sense to me is a new 10.5-inch model. The <em>idea</em> makes sense &#8212; keeping the physical footprint of the current 9.7-inch models but reducing the bezels and putting in a bigger display. The ideal form factor for iPads and iPhones is just a screen, like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shozen/8330191869">the phones</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I9MsT7juTM">Rian Johnson&#8217;s <em>Looper</em></a> &#8212; reducing the size of bezels and moving toward edge-to-edge displays is inevitable. Even the pixel density math <a href="https://blog.studioneat.com/why-would-apple-release-a-10-5-ipad-ca4441f7f628">works out</a> for a 10.5-inch display.</p>

<p>What doesn&#8217;t make sense to me is the timing. I don&#8217;t see how an iPad with an exciting new design could debut alongside <em>updated</em> versions of the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads. Who would buy the updated 9.7-inch iPad Pro with the traditional bezels if there&#8217;s a 10.5-inch model without bezels? No one.</p>

<p>The report from the Barclays analysts back in November tries to make sense of it thus: &#8220;We expect the 9.7-inch to move to a low-cost model&#8221;. The idea would be that the new design takes over as the high-end model with the standard footprint, and the 9.7-inch models with the old form factor move down the lineup to the mid-priced tier. But that doesn&#8217;t square with the rampant rumors that Apple is preparing an <em>update</em> to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. If Apple were going to replace the bezeled 9.7-inch design with an edge-to-edge 10.5-inch design, they would just lower the price of the current iPad Pro, without changing the hardware. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve done every single time they&#8217;ve introduced new iPads in recent years &#8212; the new models keep the same prices as the old ones, and the old ones move down the lineup with lower prices.</p>

<p>That still doesn&#8217;t make sense to me though. Why would Apple update the standard-sized iPad Pro to a new edge-to-edge design but keep the existing design for the more expensive 12.9-inch iPad? The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro would look dated on day one. Mac Otakara&#8217;s speculation that the new 10.5-inch iPad might not ship until May (with the updated 9.7- and 12.9-inch models shipping in March) doesn&#8217;t help with the logic, either. If Apple announces all these new iPads at the same time, you have the same problems mentioned above. If they release the updated 9.7- and 12.9-inch models in March, but keep the new 10.5-inch model under wraps until May, anyone who buys one of the updated 9.7-inch models in the interim is going to be justifiably outraged.</p>

<p>Applying Occam&#8217;s razor to these rumors, I think the most likely explanation is that Apple <em>is</em> working on a new edge-to-edge design iPad with a 10.5-inch display, but that it&#8217;s a 2018 thing, not a 2017 thing. Or, at the very earliest, a late 2017 thing &#8212; something they could unveil in October. If that&#8217;s the case, almost everything makes sense:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros debut later this month or early in April, possibly in low-key fashion.</li>
<li>New iPhones debut in September, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-8/">much-speculated-upon new model</a> with an all-new edge-to-edge design made possible in part by a flexible OLED display.</li>
<li>Next year&#8217;s new iPads inherit the edge-to-edge-display/reduced-bezels design language and OLED technology of the new iPhone. Among all the other aforementioned things that don&#8217;t make sense regarding the rumor that a 10.5-inch iPad is imminent is the idea that the new design language would debut on an iPad, not an iPhone.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<strong>A brief interpolation regarding the rumors about a new iPhone with an exciting new edge-to-edge design debuting this September:</strong> There are also rumors about updated iPhones with the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays. If all of this is true, then I would expect that the updates to the 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones will be rather pedestrian. The &#8220;S&#8221; models over the years have typically introduced major new component improvements. For the same reason that it makes no sense for Apple to introduce a flashy new edge-to-edge 10.5-inch iPad alongside major updates to the existing iPads, it would make no sense to introduce a flashy new edge-to-edge iPhone alongside <em>major</em> updates to the existing iPhones. If there is a flashy new edge-to-edge iPhone design, what would make sense for updated 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones would be something very much akin to the iPhone SE &#8212; minor component updates and a clear position in the product lineup at a tier <em>beneath</em> the new edge-to-edge flagship model. (I also find it interesting that there are only rumors of a single new iPhone with the new edge-to-edge display &#8212; if true, that says to me that Apple is going back to a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; lineup at the flagship tier. They&#8217;ve had record-breaking success with the &#8220;two sizes&#8221; strategy, but it might make sense to go back to one size if they can fit a 5.x-inch display and a larger battery into a form factor roughly the size of the current 4.7-inch models.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one other way this rumor of both a new edge-to-edge design iPhone <em>and</em> updates to the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhone makes sense to me: if (a) the new 4.7- and 5.5-inch models are traditional &#8220;S&#8221; updates, with significant component improvements and the same price points as the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; and (b) the iPhone with the new edge-to-edge design has a significantly higher price than the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. And indeed, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iphone%208%20%241000">rumors suggest</a> it might have a starting price of $1,000 or higher. On paper that sounds like something Apple might do &#8212; Tim Cook would love to see the iPhone&#8217;s average selling price go up. But in practice I see the same product marketing problems as with the idea that a new edge-to-edge iPad might debut alongside major updates to the existing iPad Pros. The new iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would look dated on day one. That&#8217;s not a problem if they&#8217;re slotted into a mid-level pricing tier, but it is if they&#8217;re priced at $800-900. Yes, Apple has done something like this with Apple Watch Edition, but the Edition watches only use different materials. The Edition models don&#8217;t make the regular Apple Watches look stale; the purported edge-to-edge iPhone would do just that to the existing models. <strong>End interpolation.</strong>]</p>

<p>There&#8217;s even some evidence for this schedule of events &#8212; updates to the existing 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models soon, radical new iPhone in September, and radical new iPad after that &#8212; in the rumors surrounding these new iPads. Back in August, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/15/kuo-10-5-ipad-pro-2017/">MacRumors published the following excerpts from a report by Ming-Chi Kuo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We expect three new iPads (12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, new size
10.5-inch iPad Pro and low-cost 9.7-inch iPad) to be launched in
2017, though this may not drive shipment growth amid structural
headwinds; 2017F shipments to fall 10-20% YoY. If the iPad comes
in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be
helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education
markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad
Pro in 2017. In addition, we estimate the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 and
10.5-inch iPad Pro will adopt the A10X processor, with TSMC (2330
TT, NT$177.5, N) being the sole supplier using 10nm process
technology. The low-cost 9.7-inch model may adopt the A9X
processor, which is also exclusively supplied by TSMC. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Revolutionary iPad model likely to be introduced in 2018F at the
earliest, with radical changes in form factor design and user
behavior on adoption of flexible AMOLED panel. We believe iPad
will follow in the footsteps of the iPhone by adopting AMOLED
panel in 2018F at the earliest. If Apple can truly tap the
potential of a flexible AMOLED panel, we believe the new iPad
model will offer new selling points through radical form factor
design and user behavior changes, which could benefit shipments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me that Apple would introduce a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017 <em>and</em> &#8220;radical changes in form factor design&#8221; in 2018. It would make a lot of sense if the 10.5-inch model <em>is</em> the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; iPad scheduled for 2018.</p>

<p>Also, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro <em>already</em> sports the A9X chip. Again, it would both make sense and fit with the history of the iPad lineup if a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro &#8220;2&#8221; replaced the current iPad Pro &#8220;1&#8221; at the top of the lineup, and if the iPad Pro &#8220;1&#8221; replaced the iPad Air 2 as the lower-priced 9.7-inch model.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://t.co/mcymKLYyIN">Takashi Mochizuki, reporting for The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People familiar with Apple’s plans said the iPhone releases this
year would include two models with the traditional LCD and a third
one with an OLED screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly in line with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/09/kgi-predicts-wireless-charging-for-all-three-new-iphones-iphone-8-requires-higher-cost-3d-touch-sensor/">Ming Chi Kuo&#8217;s report</a> from a few weeks ago:</p>

<ul>
<li>A single new high-end (and higher-priced) iPhone with a physical width similar to that of an iPhone 7, but with an edge-to-edge design that allows for a display closer in size to a 7 Plus. (I&#8217;m guessing &#8220;iPhone Pro&#8221;.)</li>
<li><p>Two new models similar to the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (presumably the &#8220;7S&#8221; and &#8220;7S Plus&#8221;).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They said Apple would introduce other updates including a USB-C
port for the power cord and other peripheral devices, instead of
the company’s original Lightning connector. The models would also
do away with a physical home button, they said. Those updates
would give the iPhone features already available on other
smartphones.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a terribly-written paragraph. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus already have no physical home button. Is he saying the Touch ID sensor is going away? Which new iPhones is Mochizuki claiming will have USB-C ports instead of Lightning? Only the high-end OLED model with the edge-to-edge display, or all three? It doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me that Apple would switch any iPhone to USB-C, but if they&#8217;re going to switch one, they should switch all of them.</p>

<p>If Apple had any plans to switch from Lightning to USB-C, why wouldn&#8217;t they have switched last year with the iPhone 7, when they started making tens of millions of pairs of Lightning ear buds? Why did they put a Lightning port on the AirPods case? My expectation has been that iPhones will <em>never</em> switch to USB-C &#8212; that Apple would stick with Lightning until they can do away with external ports entirely.</p>

<p>I have no inside dope on this, but it rings false to my ears. If there&#8217;s any truth to it, I&#8217;d bet that this year&#8217;s iPhones will ship with USB-C <em>chargers</em>, that use a USB-C to Lightning cable to connect to the phones. <em>That</em> makes sense, given that Apple has dropped USB-A ports from the newest MacBook models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using OLED displays would allow Apple to introduce a phone with a
new look to fuel sales. Apple’s last major design overhaul came
with the iPhone 6, a slimmer phone with larger displays that
helped reignite sales growth and propel the company to record
profit. The iPhone 7, introduced in September 2016, came with a
similar design to its predecessor, contributing to slower sales in
China. Analysts say Chinese consumers feel more motivated to buy a
new phone when it has a different look that gives it appeal as a
status symbol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get it. All things considered, a new iPhone that <em>looks</em> new is going to be more exciting than one that re-uses an existing design. I also get that, for cultural reasons, this is particularly true in China. (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/stop-doubting-the-iphone-the-macintosh-company-2/">Ben Thompson has been emphasizing this</a> for years.)</p>

<p>But this idea that anything short of a radically new design is bad for Apple <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/09/design_as_branding">just isn&#8217;t true</a>. Based on the above passage, a reader would logically conclude that iPhones sales are down because the industrial design is too similar to its predecessor. But <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2017/01/31Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html">Apple just reported the highest iPhone sales in a quarter ever</a>. Again, if they can meet demand, an exciting new hardware design should drive sales even higher &#8212; but it&#8217;s completely wrong to suggest that the similar-to-the-6/6S design of the iPhone 7 has led to a slump.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/02/19/wondrich-barstools">Speaking of martinis</a>, out of curiosity I tried asking my Amazon Echo &#8220;How do you make a martini?&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/832810675307155457">The answer was appalling</a>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The martini is a cocktail made with 1 part gin and 6 parts vermouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those of you who enjoy a martini know that that recipe is <em>backwards</em>, and would make for a truly wretched drink &#8212; the International Bartenders Association standard recipe for a dry martini calls for 6 parts gin to 1 part vermouth. If anything, many <a href="https://drizly.com/Churchill_Martini/r-c91cc754dc399cea">martini aficionados</a> prefer <em>less</em> vermouth than the IBA recipe.</p>

<p>Given the same query, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/02/siri-martini.png">Siri tells you</a> (rather ungrammatically) &#8220;The main ingredient in martini (cocktail) is gin&#8221;, and points you to Wikipedia, which offers the IBA recipe. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/02/google-asst-martini-1.png">Google Assistant on a Pixel tells you</a> &#8220;The Martini is a cocktail made with gin and vermouth, and garnished with an olive or a lemon twist.&#8221; You can then tap &#8220;Ingredients&#8221; <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2017/02/google-asst-martini-2.png">to be shown a recipe</a> with the IBA standard 6-to-1 gin-to-vermouth ratio.</p>

<p>Neither Siri nor Google Assistant are perfect here, but both put you one tap away from getting an acceptable recipe. Google gets points for doing it entirely within the Assistant interface (rather than punting you over to a web browser), but Siri gets points because Wikipedia&#8217;s page contains instructions on <em>how</em> to prepare the drink, not just what to put in it.</p>

<p>Alexa&#8217;s response is clearly the most ambitious, but it&#8217;s by far the worst because it&#8217;s so criminally wrong. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, go check Wikipedia&#8221; is a much better response than a wrong answer.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Two days after I tweeted about this, Alexa now correctly prescribes 6 parts of gin to 1 of vermouth.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an announcement from Apple that I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed in a hundred tries: <a href="http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/02/wwdc-apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-to-san-jose-june-5-9-2017.html">they&#8217;re moving WWDC back to the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose</a>.</p>

<p>The dates for WWDC 2017 are June 5–9. But the ticketing process isn&#8217;t until March 27. Like in previous years, it&#8217;ll be a lottery-type application system.</p>

<p>I had the chance to speak with Phil Schiller about this yesterday. The call was scheduled a few days in advance, but as usual with Apple, I didn&#8217;t know the topic. I spent the intervening days trying to guess. Moving WWDC back to San Jose truly didn&#8217;t even enter my mind. But now that I&#8217;ve had a day to think about it, I can see the logic.</p>

<p>First, announcing early really helps people who have to travel long distances to attend, particularly those from outside the U.S. In recent years, Apple has announced WWDC dates in April &#8212; as early as April 3 in 2014, and as late as April 28. Announcing the dates now, in mid-February, should help people save on airfare. It&#8217;s another sign that Apple is slowly getting more open. (Let&#8217;s see if they announce the dates this early next year too. It&#8217;s possible they only announced this early this year to brace people for the venue change.)</p>

<p>For people who will travel <em>only</em> if they get a conference pass, the timing doesn&#8217;t change as much. But even a few extra weeks is an improvement. And in recent years &#8212; particularly since the demise of Macworld Expo &#8212; WWDC is more than just the developer conference. <a href="http://www.imore.com/un-conventional-how-wwdc-became-heart-apple-worlds-calendar">It&#8217;s become the communal heart of the Apple world&#8217;s calendar</a>. I know more people who come to WWDC without passes for the conference than who attend.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sanjose.org/convention-center">The San Jose Convention Center</a> is the original home of WWDC &#8212; that&#8217;s where it was held from 1988 through 2002. (WWDC 2002 was the year Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1SLCAiGkVQ">held a funeral for Mac OS 9 during the keynote</a>.) San Jose is <em>way</em> closer to Apple headquarters. San Francisco is about an hour drive from 1 Infinite Loop. The San Jose Convention Center is only minutes away from Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/08/03/apple-sets-stage-for-san-jose-campus-with-15000-workers/">new San Jose campus</a>, and is much closer to their Cupertino headquarters than San Francisco. Schiller emphasized to me that this is a big deal: more Apple employees from more teams will be present, simply because they won&#8217;t have to devote an entire day to being there. (This could be a particular boon to WWDC&#8217;s developer labs, where attendees can get precious face time with Apple&#8217;s engineers.)</p>

<p>I asked whether the move to San Jose changed the number of people who&#8217;d be able to attend. Schiller said it did not &#8212; attendance will be about the same. (To my knowledge, Apple has never revealed exact attendance figures, and Schiller didn&#8217;t offer an exact number, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/04/why-wwdc-is-too-big/">it&#8217;s somewhere around 5,000</a>.)</p>

<p>My first WWDC was 2006, a few years after the move to San Francisco, so I&#8217;ve never been to one in San Jose. The rap from my friends who did attend WWDC back when it was in San Jose is that San Jose was a bit of a sleepy town. It&#8217;s a work-oriented city, where it gets quiet after 5 pm. But WWDC was, compared to now, sparsely attended back then. WWDC didn&#8217;t sell out until 2008 (the first year of the iPhone App Store).</p>

<p>Schiller seems confident that there&#8217;s going to be a lot going on outside the convention center. Apple is working with the city and San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo to stage events around the downtown area throughout the week.</p>

<p>WWDC is the biggest event of the year for the Apple world. But for the city of San Francisco, it&#8217;s just another conference at Moscone. In fact, by Moscone standards, WWDC is actually kind of small. <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/how-big-is-openworld-2019871.pdf">Oracle&#8217;s OpenWorld conference</a> has over 60,000 attendees &#8212; 12 times the size of WWDC. <strong>Update:</strong> Salesforce&#8217;s Dreamforce conference <a href="http://stuarte.co/2016/dreamforce-attendance-numbers-year/">had 170,000 attendees last year</a>.</p>

<p>WWDC will be the biggest thing going on in San Jose that week. I don&#8217;t have a feel for San Jose &#8212; the only time I&#8217;ve ever set foot there was for <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/23/technology/mobile/apple-ipad-mini-event/">Apple&#8217;s 2012 October event</a>. I could see it going one of two ways: either dreadfully dull, or, something akin to SXSW in Austin, where the conference and its attendees more or less take over the entire convention center area downtown. In San Francisco, WWDC attendees are a small school of like-minded fish in a big pond. In San Jose, they&#8217;ll own the pond. WWDC’s presence can expand outside the confines of McEnery in a way that it can’t expand outside Moscone.</p>

<p>One last factor, unstated by Apple, but very obvious to anyone who knows how to comparison shop for hotel rooms: downtown San Jose is way cheaper than downtown San Francisco, and the surrounding area has a ton of good hotel rooms at very affordable rates. In San Francisco nice hotels are very expensive, and the hotels that aren&#8217;t expensive are not nice. In recent years, a lot of people who come to WWDC have been booking hotels down closer to San Jose simply because they&#8217;re so much cheaper.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my take:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For Apple, this is a win. They&#8217;ll cumulatively spend thousands of fewer hours driving up and down Highway 280. They have the potential to involve their soon-to-open new campus in the event somehow. They have more influence and control over the area around the convention center, rather than just inside it.</p></li>
<li><p>For attendees, it&#8217;s hard to say. For those on a budget, it&#8217;s surely a win. San Jose is way more affordable than San Francisco. (But the hotels closest to the convention center in downtown San Jose are running around $350 a night &#8212; no savings at all compared to Moscone-area hotels in San Francisco.) For those more concerned with the social scene, it&#8217;s too early to judge. If it resembles the social scene from the previous era of San Jose WWDCs, it&#8217;ll be a bust. If you&#8217;d asked me in recent years whether it&#8217;s worth it to go to WWDC even if you&#8217;re not attending the conference proper, I&#8217;d have said yes without hesitation. I really don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s going to be true now that it&#8217;s in San Jose.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The word that comes to mind is <em>nostalgia</em>. For most of the regular WWDC attendees in my circle, San Francisco and Moscone are all we know. There&#8217;s an established familiarity to the places (<a href="http://eggfreckles.net/favorite/gruber/">hotels</a>, restaurants, bars) and the schedule. Even if WWDC works out great in San Jose, there is a lot that I will miss about WWDC&#8217;s years in San Francisco. But WWDC is only moving, not ending, so it&#8217;s a very different nostalgia than that for Macworld Expo.</p>

<p>WWDC in San Jose hearkens back to what was truly a different era for Apple. When the last WWDC was held in San Jose in 2002, the original iPod was only six months old, and I was three months away from starting Daring Fireball. An investment in Apple stock in 2002 <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=aapl+2000+to+2017">would have increased around a hundredfold</a> if held through today.</p>

<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t like to explain itself. I don&#8217;t know why Apple moved WWDC to San Francisco in 2003. But my guess is that they sought more media attention. Apple went to where the attention was. Today, the attention comes to Apple. They could hold WWDC in the middle of a desert and it would still sell out in an instant and there&#8217;d be the same convoy of media trucks outside the hall the morning of the keynote. If a large corporation can be described as a homebody, Apple is it. And San Francisco is not Apple&#8217;s home turf.</p>

<p>Schiller has been at Apple (and on stage at WWDC) throughout this entire run, and he seems ready to go back. &#8220;It feels like WWDC is going home,&#8221; he told me.</p>
